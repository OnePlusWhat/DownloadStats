Github release checker bat, packaged by Snjo

This python script is by tom_mai78101, from http://www.thehelper.net/threads/python-3-x-github-download-counter-code-by-mmilidoni.161871/

To use, install python 3.4.1, included, or download it online.
You will need the "requests" package, which you get by running:
C:\Python34\Scripts\pip3.4.exe install requests

Now you can run the included stats.bat file, or edit the example "Firespitter stats.bat" to match your own repo.
